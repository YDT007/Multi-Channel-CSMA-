# Multi Channel CSMA 
 REVIEW OF OPTIMIZING TRANSMIT INTENSITY IN MULTI CHANNEL CSMA A Distributed Approximation Framework

In this project I have reviewed a work that was basically a part of my summer internship of 2024.
Functions Used-
1) ELSclique : It finds maximal cliques using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm with
   both pivoting and degeneracy ordering.
   AUTHOR: YANHAO WEI
   DATE: AUG, 2014
   BASED ON: maximalCliques() by Jeffrey Wildman, 2011  
3) graph_topolgy: To generate a graph having  certain no of edges and vertices
4) service_rate_DiffDensity: For calculating service rate where network topologies will have different densities
5) Service_rate_ConDensity:  For calculating service rate where network topologies will have constant densities
6) service_rate_final: Inorder to calculate error while having different channel openings
7) PDF: Extensive project report
